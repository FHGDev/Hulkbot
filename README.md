# Premium - UPDATED
I finally worked something out for premium payments! I am currently writing and implementing the Hulkbot Premium module! It will be out soon!

# Backstory
Not many bots have a backstory. Hulkbot does though! A quite lengthy one to be exact.  
Hulkbot began as a measley music bot for my server, running SexualRhinoceros's MusicBot. I eventually was inspired to make my own bot that was more than just a fork of somebody else's code. Development of Alpha Hulkbot began in March of 2017! I developed the first stable version of Hulkbot in Node.js version 7, using Discord.js v9. Let's fast-forward to 2018. Hulkbot died due to some really bad real life issues on my end, and I really didn't know how to fix it. I waited a year, and something inspired me to rewrite a better, more stable version of Hulkbot. Hulkbot's second first birthday will be November 13th, 2020.
